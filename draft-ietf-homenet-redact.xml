      <t>This document updates the Home Networking Control Protocol, eliminating the recommendation for a default top-level
	name for local name resolution.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Homenet working group has defined a mechanism for sharing information between homenet routers, in Home Networking
	Control Protocol <xref target="RFC7788"/>.   This document recomments the use of the ".home" top-level name as a
	locally-resolved domain name.</t>

      <t>RFC7788 did not follow the process defined in Special Use Domain Names <xref target="RFC6761"/>.   It is likely that,
	had this process been followed, it would not have been possible to gain consensus on the use of '.home' as the
	locally-resolved special-use top-level name for homenets, because this name is known to be informally in use by
	sites on the internet, and the use to which this name has been put is not well documented; it is impossible to
	say that there are no conflicting uses for the name, and so getting consensus to use it anyway would have been
	controversial, time consuming, and possibly futile.</t>

      <t>The RFC6761 process is not well-understood within the IETF, and the authors of RFC7788 were not aware
	of it.   Normally, authors are not expected to know all there is to know about IETF process, and IETF leadership,
	specifically working group chairs, area directors and directorate members are expected to engage in a review process
	that notices oversights of this sort.</t>

      <t>Unfortunately, in the case of RFC7788, none of the people who should have caught the missing RFC6761 reference
	did catch it, and RFC 7788 was published as a consensus document that uses '.home' without ever reserving it
	in the RFC6761 Special-Use Domain Names registry.</t>

    <section title="Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol">
      <t>This document updates RFC 7788: '.home' MUST NOT be used as the default name
         for resolution within the home network.   The new default value is specified in <xref target="I-D.pfister-homenet-dot"/></t>
